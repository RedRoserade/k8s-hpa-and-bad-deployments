# k8s HPA tests

Demo repository that shows HPA behaviour on deployments with proper `selector.matchLabels` and without.

It contains two deployment files, each two deployment objects:

- One, which consumes zero CPU (`myapp-no-cpu`). The average CPU usage will be 0%.
- Another, which consumes all available CPU (`myapp-full-cpu`). The average CPU usage will be 100%.

It also contains a HPA object that scales the pods if average CPU usage of the deployment that uses all CPU (`myapp-no-cpu`) reaches 40% (which will never happen).

# Setup

You will need a K8s cluster with metrics server. You can use [KiND](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind).

This repo provides a script to [create the metrics server in KiND](./create-metrics-server.sh), in case you need to create one.

# Testing a proper deployment

The deployment with proper label selector will correctly select their pods. This means that HPA is able to correctly calculate the CPU metrics for the pods, and thus determine that no scaling is required.

Run the following to deploy:

```shell
kubectl apply -f k8s-hpa.yaml -f k8s-proper-deployments.yaml
```

You should see the following, after about 2 minutes:

- 1 pod for the deployment with no cpu
- 1 pod for the deployment with full cpu

```

To clean up:

```shell
kubectl delete -f k8s-hpa.yaml -f k8s-proper-deployments.yaml
```

Wait 30 seconds before re-deploying to ensure everything is cleaned.

# Testing a broken deployment

Here, the deployments have a label selector that matches labels of other pods. This causes the HPA to incorrectly calculate the CPU usage metrics. The result is, the deployment with 0 cpu usage is scaled to 3 replicas.

Run the following to deploy:

```shell
kubectl apply -f k8s-hpa.yaml -f k8s-broken-deployments.yaml
```

You should see the following, after about 2 minutes:

- 3 pods for the deployment with no cpu
- 1 pod for the deployment with full cpu
